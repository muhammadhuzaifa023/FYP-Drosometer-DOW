                    <p align="justify">Drosophila wings are known for their unique structure, with a characteristic
                        pattern of veins and
                        other features that make them an important model for genetic and developmental studies. The
                        wings consist of five longitudinal veins, two cross veins, and various other structures such as
                        trichomes and hairs that are distributed across the surface and edge of the wing.
                        These features provide a visual representation of the activity of conserved signaling
                        pathways that are relevant to human health and disease. By analyzing the structure of
                        Drosophila wings, researchers can gain insights into the genetic and developmental
                        processes
                        that underlie organ development, growth, and tissue regeneration.</p>

                                detailed information on the dimensions of the wings, including area and perimeter
                                measurements, and individual segment dimensions.</p>
